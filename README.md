# Used Car Price Prediction Competition
## Description

The demand for used cars has surged, creating an expansive market with the need for accurate pricing strategies. In response to this challenge, we present the Used Car Price Prediction Competition. Participants are tasked with developing machine learning models to predict the prices of used cars based on provided features. By doing so, contributors can aid businesses in formulating effective pricing strategies and gaining a competitive advantage in the growing pre-owned car market.[Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/used-car-price-prediction-competition2)


## Practice Skills

- Creative feature engineering: analyzing and transforming the provided features to enhance the performance of the models.
- Advanced regression techniques to build predictive models like random forest and gradient boosting.

## Evaluation

### Goal

It is your job to predict the price for each car. For each id in the test set, you must predict the value of the Price (Target) variable.

### Metric

Submissions are evaluated on R-Squared (RÂ²), a statistical measure in a regression model that determines the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variable.

## Submission File Format

The submission file should contain a header and follow this format:

```plaintext
id	Target
1	581851
2	4552.2
3	548122
```
